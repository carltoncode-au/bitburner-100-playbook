# Strategy

## Early Game

### Completed

- Built the first distributed automation network.
- Purchased the TOR Router.
- Acquired the first five port-opening programs during Run 2.
- Joined Sector-12, CyberSec, and NiteSec.
- Installed the first augmentation batch.
- Rebuilt and expanded the hacking network after the first installation.
- Completed a second, much larger augmentation cycle.
- Began Run 3 with substantially stronger hacking multipliers.

### Current Strategy

Run 3 is a rapid rebuild cycle. The second augmentation batch increased hacking money, hacking level, hacking experience, and hacking speed enough that hacking skill is climbing far faster than in earlier runs. The immediate goal is to use `deploy.js V2` to restore the network quickly, rejoin the hacking factions, and return to the strongest available progression path without spending long on low-value early-game work.

### Current Priorities

1. Keep distributed hacking active while rebuilding.
2. Rejoin CyberSec and NiteSec as soon as their servers are available.
3. Finish rebuilding the essential program set.
4. Use the improved augmentation multipliers to accelerate faction access.
5. Avoid unnecessary Hacknet spending unless it supports an achievement or clear income goal.
6. Prepare the next augmentation batch only after meaningful faction progress.

# Scripts

## Scripts in Use

| Script | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| worker.js | Distributed hack / grow / weaken automation | ✅ Active |
| deploy.js V2 | Scans, roots, deploys, and starts workers more efficiently | ✅ Active |
| scan.js | Network discovery | ✅ Available |
| n00dles.js | Early-game hacking helper | ✅ Available |
| hack.js | Dedicated hacking action | ✅ Available |
| grow.js | Dedicated growth action | ✅ Available |
| weaken.js | Dedicated security reduction action | ✅ Available |

## deploy.js V2

The revised deployment script replaces the earlier manual deployment workflow. Its purpose is to make post-augmentation recovery faster by discovering eligible servers, gaining root access where possible, copying the worker script, and using available RAM automatically.

## Current Deployment

Automation is currently active on 12 hosts:

- n00dles
- foodnstuff
- sigma-cosmetics
- joesguns
- hong-fang-tea
- harakiri-sushi
- iron-gym
- CSEC
- max-hardware
- nectar-net
- zer0
- neo-net

# Verified Facts

Verified during this playthrough:

- Distributed automation with `worker.js` scales effectively during the early game.
- Purchasing the TOR Router early accelerates access to Dark Web tools.
- Installing augmentations resets short-term progression such as money, hacking level, active scripts, Hacknet Nodes, rooted-server access, programs, and faction membership.
- Script files stored on `home` remain available after an augmentation installation and can be redeployed.
- Installed augmentations and achievements persist through augmentation installation.
- Faction favor persists, but faction membership and reputation must be rebuilt.
- Purchased augmentations can be held without installing them immediately.
- Waiting to install several augmentations together avoids unnecessary repeated resets.
- Stronger augmentation batches dramatically accelerate later-run hacking growth.
- A reusable deployment script is one of the most valuable tools for recovering after a reset.

# Decisions

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2026-07-12 | Use a single `worker.js` script on all rooted servers. | Simplifies deployment while learning the game. |
| 2026-07-12 | Target only `n00dles` initially. | Provides reliable early-game income and hacking experience. |
| 2026-07-12 | Purchase the TOR Router and Dark Web programs early. | Accelerates access to more servers. |
| 2026-07-12 | Install the first three affordable augmentations together. | Permanent bonuses outweighed the temporary reset. |
| 2026-07-13 | Restore the distributed network immediately after the first reset. | Reusable scripts allowed Run 2 to overtake Run 1 quickly. |
| 2026-07-13 | Begin creating ServerProfiler.exe before relaySMTP.exe unlocks. | Made productive use of time while progressing toward Hacking Level 250. |
| 2026-07-13 | Join NiteSec and begin hacking contracts. | Opened access to stronger hacking-focused augmentations. |
| 2026-07-13 | Purchase Cranial Signal Processors - Gen I without installing it immediately. | Allowed more augmentations to be accumulated before the next reset. |
| 2026-07-20 | Continue the second augmentation cycle until a substantial batch was ready. | Maximized the value of the next reset. |
| 2026-07-21 | Install the second augmentation batch and begin Run 3. | The combined hacking bonuses were large enough to justify resetting. |
| 2026-07-21 | Replace the original deployment workflow with deploy.js V2. | Speeds up recovery and reduces repetitive manual deployment work. |

- NeuroFlux Governor provided a final permanent gain when other faction purchases were exhausted.

---

## Session 6 – Start of Run 3

### Major Milestones

- Began Run 3 with 10 installed augmentations.
- Created deploy.js V2.

# Research Notes

## Documentation

Pending.

## Source Code

Pending.

## Community Guides

Pending.

## Session 3 Discoveries

- Automation can be restored rapidly after an augmentation installation because script files remain on `home`.
- Program creation can be paused and resumed without losing progress.

## Session 4 Discoveries

- Purchased augmentations do not need to be installed immediately.
- Distributed automation can continue running while the player performs faction work.

## Session 5 Discoveries

- Faction donations become available after building sufficient favor.
- A final NeuroFlux Governor purchase can use money and reputation that would otherwise be lost on reset.
- The value of an augmentation cycle depends more on the combined multiplier package than the raw number of purchases.

## Session 6 Discoveries

- Faction memberships reset after augmentation installation, while faction favor persists.
- Program files must be reacquired or recreated after installation.
- deploy.js V2 reduces the amount of manual work required after a reset.
- A strong hacking augmentation batch can compress many hours of early progression into a few hours.

---

# Questions To Investigate

- Optimal timing for the first purchased server.
- Whether Hacknet investment remains worthwhile outside achievement goals.
- Best order for rejoining CyberSec, NiteSec, and The Black Hand.
- Best transition away from early-game targets.
- Batch hacking design.
- Best augmentation purchase order for the third cycle.
- When to begin purchased-server infrastructure.
- Whether deploy.js V2 should automatically choose a stronger target than `n00dles`.
- When to begin using faction RAM sharing.
- Which remaining Sector-12 augmentations are worth buying during Run 3.
